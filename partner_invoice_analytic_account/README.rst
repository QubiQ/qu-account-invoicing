================================
Partner Invoice Analytic Account
================================

Allows to set an analytic account for sales and another one for purchases for every partner. Those accounts will be used by default on orders and invoices.


Installation
============

Just install.


Configuration
=============

Go to Sales -> Orders -> Customers, choose a partner and set the "Sales Analytic Account" and "Purchases Analytic Account" under the Sales and Purchases tab. The functionality of this module is company dependent.


Usage
=====

On sale orders, when the partner is chosen the specified analytic account is transferred to the order.
When the invoice is created from the sale order, its analytic account is transferred to every invoice line.
If an invoice is created without a sale order or a purchase order, the analytic account will be taken directly from the partner.
